Description: Forecasting daily time seriers with 
    multiplicative double seasonalities, within-week 
    seasonal cycle and within-year seasonal cycle in R. 
    The model is adjusted for holiday effect. It is also
    robust to outliers.
    The package is developed during my intern in
    Amplify AI and Business Team, Microsoft.
